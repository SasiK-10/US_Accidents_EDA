# US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction

This project explores a dataset of US road accidents to identify key patterns and trends. It also includes a predictive model for accident severity.

## Overview

The analysis delves into various factors associated with US accidents, aiming to understand when, where, and under what conditions accidents are most likely to occur and how severe they might be.

## Key Findings

* **Geographic Distribution:** A high concentration of accidents was observed in California and densely populated urban areas.
* **Severity:** Most accidents fall into the moderate severity category, though a notable percentage are classified as severe.
* **Time of Day:** Accident frequency peaks during morning (AM) and evening (PM) commute hours on weekdays. Weekend patterns show variations.
* **Day of Week:** Weekdays generally exhibit higher accident counts compared to weekends, with Thursday often showing the highest frequency.
* **Environmental Factors:** The analysis explored potential relationships between accident occurrence and factors like temperature and time of year.
* **Predictive Modeling:** A Decision Tree classifier was developed and trained to predict accident severity based on selected features from the dataset.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)
* Seaborn (for enhanced data visualization)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning model implementation)
